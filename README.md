# fidget-2.0
Rebuild an earlier project from the ground up. Sharpen up on my JS/Node/Express and MongoDB skills. A lightweight "reddit-clone" for posting and interacting. Final version will include authentication and user profile page.

Helpful and fun to build and design. Google Oauth produced issues, so I pulled it for the sake of deployment. I'll go in afterwards and add Google OAuth or use token-based login later. For now, everyone can edit/delete everything, and user names are optional at time of post. 

# Technologies

dotenv, ejs, mongoose, morgan, path, serve-favicon, method-override (passport and passport-google-oauth are unused right now)
